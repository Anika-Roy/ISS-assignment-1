Link to github repo: https://github.com/Anika-Roy/ISS-assignment-1.git
## Q1
The Q1 folder contains 2 .sh files-one for each sub part, a quotes.txt file which is the same as the one provided and 2 output files.The names of these files have been hardcoded in my code.
### Instruction to compile and run
```
$ ./Q1_A.sh
$ ./Q1_B.sh
```
## Q2
The Q2 folder contains 1 .sh file, a quotes.txt file which is the same as the one provided and 1 output file named 'speech.txt'.The names of these files have been hardcoded in my code.
### Instruction to compile and run
```
$ ./Q2.sh
```

## Q3
The Q3 folder contains 1 .sh files, a hello.txt file which I wrote for testing the code and 1 temporary file named 'temp.txt'.
### Instruction to compile and run
```
$ ./Q3.sh <filename>
```
#### Some important points to keep in mind
* my code writes an intermediate output onto temp.txt and then uses that as input.so its name has been hardcoded in my code
* running the code multiple times keeps on appending to temp.txt but the output remains correct

## Q4
The Q4 folder contains 1 .sh file.
### Instruction to compile and run
```
$ ./Q4.sh
```

## Q5
The Q5 folder contains 1 .sh file.
### Instruction to compile and run
```
