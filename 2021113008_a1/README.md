## Q1
The names of these files(quotes.txt and output files) have been hardcoded in my code.
### Instruction to compile and run
```
$ ./q1.sh
```
## Q2
The names of the files (quotes.txt and speech.txt) have been hardcoded in my code.
### Instruction to compile and run
```
$ ./q2.sh
```

## Q3
The q3 has 1 .sh file.My code will generate a temporary file named temp.txt.
### Instruction to compile and run
```
$ ./q3.sh <filename>
```
#### Some important points to keep in mind
* my code writes an intermediate output onto temp.txt and then uses that as input.so its name has been hardcoded in my code
* running the code multiple times keeps on appending to temp.txt but the output remains correct

## Q4
 Q4 has 1 .sh file.
### Instruction to compile and run
```
$ ./q4.sh
```

## Q5
